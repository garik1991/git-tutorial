git init
git status
git add index.html(or click + button on the right of every file)
git rm --cached ./git_commands(the oposite of git add)
cls(cleans the terminal in windows OS)
git add .(adds all the files with changes to be commited)
.gitignore contains all file/directory names that should not be commited
git branch(shows the branch the developer is working on)
git branch test(creates a new branch with the name test)

git branch -D test(deletes the branch)
git checkout test
git checkout -b test(creates a new branch and checkouts it immediately)

git push / pushes all the changes on that branch

git merge test(the name of the branch to be merged)
(specify this before commiting your changes to github) git config user.name Garik git config user.email ....

These are the steps one needs to do in order toconnect his local project to github

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main / this will change the initial master branch to main
(we need to implement this statement in order to add a new local branch to the github)
git remote add origin https://github.com/garik1991/git-tutorial.git
git push -u origin main

Implement git pull command every time you start to work on something

git rm file.txt or . or *.txt will remove the file both from workflow and directory

git rm --cached -r logs/   //if you have already added this file to git and commited the command can unstage it, then you can add it to gitignore

git diff --staged  shows the changes

git log //shows commit history
